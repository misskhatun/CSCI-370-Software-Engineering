# A. Designs

**Design 1:**

![image](https://github.com/qc-se-fall2021/370Fall21Sec36Team1/blob/main/GroupProject/Design-Individual/images/Minjae.PNG)

_Pros:_

1. Simple style UML that lays out good skeletal structure
2. All the classes and attributes required for the app are clear
3. The primary keys and foreign keys are clear and stated

_Cons:_

1. The functions and attributes doesn't have defined datatypes
2. The relationships between each attributes are not clearly defined
3. Functions in each classes don't show its relationship with other relations

**Design 2:**

_Pros:_

1. Simple UML Design
2. Add classes that are required have been created
3. Shows multiplicity
4. Functions in class show relationship to other classes

_Cons:_

1. Arrows do not indicate dependency
2. No DB although dont know if its required in the design process or not
3. Doesnt include location

**Design 3:**

![image](https://github.com/qc-se-fall2021/370Fall21Sec36Team1/blob/main/GroupProject/Design-Individual/images/Ensar.PNG)

_Pros:_

1. looks visually nice
2. has the user class connected to necessary classes
3. has all necessary attributes for classes

_Cons:_

1. I have arrows pointing to the DB but, not from the DB to other classes
2. My listView class isnt directly connected to the DB
3. I dont have the 1 and 0s next to the associations

**Design 4:**

![image](https://github.com/qc-se-fall2021/370Fall21Sec36Team1/blob/main/GroupProject/Design-Individual/images/Johnny.PNG)

_Pros:_

1. Has all the attributes specified in the assignment
2. Looks simple visually

_Cons:_

1. Has basic arrows pointing to each class
2. Primary Keys and Foreign Keys are not clear

**Design 5:**

![image](https://github.com/qc-se-fall2021/370Fall21Sec36Team1/blob/main/GroupProject/Design-Individual/images/Weixian.PNG)

_Pros:_

1. Each entity has its own name and corresponding data type.
2. Use many arrows to show the relationship between each class
3. Overall it looks clear

_Cons:_

1. May missing some operations and attributes to fulfill the requirement
2. There is no marks on the arrows like 0..\*, 1..10 etc.

**Design 6:**

![image](https://github.com/qc-se-fall2021/370Fall21Sec36Team1/blob/main/GroupProject/Design-Individual/images/Prity.PNG)

_Pros:_

1. It's a clear diagram that shows all the entities, attributes, and operations
2. Everything is stored in the Database means if you make any changes it will be saved
3. The design looks very understandable

_Cons:_

4. There are a lot of attributes and operators to take care of
5. Certain attributes will be difficult to implement just based on the design, it might change as we start implementing it
6. Some entities have the same attributes therefore data might be repeated

# B. Team Design:

![image](https://github.com/qc-se-fall2021/370Fall21Sec36Team1/blob/main/GroupProject/Design-Individual/images/Johnny.PNG)

The commonalities between this design and individual ones is that majority of designs have a class called listReminders along with a seperate class called reminder and reminder type.
The difference is that this design includes a DB while others do not along with a location. Another difference is that some designs include a user class while others do not.
The designs choices for this design was mainly made to satisfy the requirements and because the design is similar to a reminder app that already exists it was also to allow users to be able to create reminders, search and specify what type of reminders they are creating. From this they can make the reminder repeat so they dont have to keep making it. Users can also put locations on their reminders so they can know where they are going.

# C. Summary

What we learned: Learned how to pinpoint flaws and deficiency through team discussion and collaboration. We found what attributes in our designs can contribute to us as a team and what won't. We also learned how to collaboratively work with a team through Github by first effectively communicating with each other and by sharing our individual ideas so that we all can be on the same page. We also found that positive and friendly communication can dramatically increase the effictiveness of the team.
