## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Unit Testing - Test smallest units from the program and build our way up

1) Check function to add new reminder/type/description

2) Check function to delete existing reminders

3) Check function to edit reminders (everything within it including type and description)

4) Check function to search reminders

5) Check function to check/uncheck existing reminders for multiple selection

Integration Testing - Test units by integrating them and testing them as a whole

The simplicity of this app allows for combined integration testing with unit testing. Checking for integration testing is already embedded within Unit Testing.

System Testing - Testing of the fully integrated application to see if all the requirements and standards are met.

1) Test the application by using different cases and scenarios

2) Look over the requirements for the application and test all the cases that are required of this application


Regression Testing - After chages are made to the code for any deficiency found, rerun the tests that are ran before the tests to ensure everything still functions properly

### 1.2 Test Selection

Both black box and white box testing will occur in order to determine any deficiency in the program that could exist.

Black Box Testing - Functional testing and regression testing will be used to test our application. Since this test is primarily focused on the input and output of the application, that is what we will focus on to test all the functions within Unit Testing.

White Box Testing - Statement coverage and branch coverage will be used to test our application during the Unit Testing phase.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

Unit Testing Phase - Statement Coverage (All statements/commands will be excuted at least once to ensure quality of the program. The notation of the results will be recorded)

System Testing Phase - Path Coverage (All paths are executed at least once and all the numbers of paths from input to output will be recorded)

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Unit Testing - We are testing the smallest parts of the code one at a time, hence if there is an error we would know exactly where the fix needs to happen.

Integration Testing - If unit testing passes and integration testing fails, we know combining the functions causes it to fail. Therefore, we can examine which connection of functions causes it to fail and fix them.

System Testing - If both unit testing and integration testing fails, application should deploy without much problem. However, if it happens to fail, we know it's with the application deployment because both unit and integration testing passed.

### 1.5 Technology

JUnit will be used to run tests for our application.
